*An enterprise polyglot monorepo housing autonomous AI agent systems, AST knowledge graphs,
real-time conversation observability, and engineering tools — governed by spec-driven
development and navigable by both humans and AI companions.*

## ✨ What Is This?

**PolyTuring** is an enterprise monorepo for agentic engineering tools built with a first-principles
approach to code quality, documentation, and lifecycle management:

- 🔧 **Self-contained tools** — Each tool lives in its own folder with everything
  it needs: source, tests, docs, spec, and lifecycle status
- 📋 **Spec-driven development** — No code without a specification. Every
  requirement is numbered, traced, and tested
- 🤖 **Agent-native** — Built for AI agents to autonomously navigate, build,
  test, and maintain tools using ReAct and Reflexion patterns
- 🌍 **Polyglot** — Rust, Go, Python, TypeScript, Node.js, Shell — whatever fits the problem
- 🔄 **Full lifecycle** — Every tool has an SDLC status: draft → spec-review →
  in-progress → testing → review → released

## 🤖 Agent Collaboration

This repository is designed for autonomous AI agents. The
[Agent Intelligence Layer](.agents/AGENTS.md) includes:

- **6 behavioral rules** — ReAct protocol, code standards, commit conventions,
  SDD workflow, testing strategy, documentation standards
- **3 skills** — New tool scaffolding, debugging, release preparation
- **SDLC awareness** — Agents check tool status before acting
- **Divide & conquer** — Complex problems decomposed into atomic sub-tasks
- **Reflexion gates** — Self-critique after every significant action

## 🎯 Make Targets

```bash
make help              # Show all targets
make setup             # Install pre-commit hooks
make new-tool NAME=x   # Scaffold a new tool
make test              # Test ALL tools
make test-tool T=name  # Test a specific tool
make lint              # Lint ALL tools
make lint-tool T=name  # Lint a specific tool
make validate-specs    # Validate all specs
make catalog           # Regenerate tool catalog
make status            # SDLC status dashboard
make clean             # Clean artifacts
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

```
1. Spec First     →  Write the spec before code
2. Scaffold       →  make new-tool NAME=my-tool
3. Implement      →  Write code in tools/my-tool/src/
4. Test           →  make test-tool T=my-tool
5. Document       →  Update README, examples, CHANGELOG
6. Review         →  Submit PR with SDD checklist
7. Release        →  Tag and publish
```
