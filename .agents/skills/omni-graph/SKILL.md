# 🧭 Omni-Graph Codebase Intelligence Skill

This skill gives coding agents **deterministic AST analysis, multi-workspace exploration, and vector similarity search** across indexed codebases, condensing multi-file call chains into high-signal prompt slices (<1,500 tokens).

Always use this skill instead of running blind recursive `grep -rn` or reading whole files sequentially.

---

## 🎯 When to Use

1. **Exploring an Unfamiliar Codebase**: When you need to understand the architectural subsystems, packages, or directory relationships without reading hundreds of files.
2. **Locating Exact Symbol Definitions**: Finding functions, structs, classes, or interfaces, their exact line ranges, and signatures without regex text false positives.
3. **Tracing Callers & References**: Finding every function that calls a specific method or imports a package.
4. **Extracting Call Subgraphs**: Pulling a 1-to-3 hop directional call graph slice around a target function directly into your context.
5. **High-Level Conceptual Questions**: Asking "How does X feature work?" and getting a hybrid Graph-RAG answer combining macroscopic summaries with microscopic code slices.

## ⚡ Quick Make Commands (From Repository Root)

The easiest way to interact with Omni-Graph is via the root `Makefile`:

```bash
# 1. Discover all indexed codebases / workspaces
make workspaces

# 2. Inspect architectural subsystems (Galaxies) for a workspace
make graph-galaxies PROJECT=session-explorer
make graph-galaxies PROJECT=DSA

# 3. Locate exact symbol definition (LSP textDocument/definition)
make graph-symbol SYM=extractWorkspace PROJECT=session-explorer

# 4. Find all callers of a symbol (LSP textDocument/references)
make graph-references SYM=extractWorkspace PROJECT=session-explorer

# 5. Extract a condensed AST call graph slice (<1500 tokens)
make graph-condense SYM=extractWorkspace PROJECT=session-explorer HOPS=2

# 6. Semantic vector similarity code search
make search-graph Q="session scanner" PROJECT=session-explorer K=5

# 7. Hybrid Graph-RAG architectural query
make query-graph Q="How does session extraction and date parsing work?" PROJECT=session-explorer

# 8. Augment knowledge graph with dynamic runtime relationships
make relate-graph SRC="ChatUI" TGT="FastAPI" TYPE="ROUTES_TO" PROJECT="QuarkDock"
```

## 🛠️ CLI Script Commands (`omni.sh`)

You can also use `./tools/omni-graph/scripts/omni.sh` directly:

### 1. Architectural Subsystem Mapping (`galaxies`)
```bash
./tools/omni-graph/scripts/omni.sh galaxies [workspace]
```
Displays an ASCII table of detected Louvain/Leiden modular clusters, dominant file paths, node counts, and key symbol entrypoints.

### 2. Symbol Definition Lookup (`symbol`)
```bash
./tools/omni-graph/scripts/omni.sh symbol "init_pool" [workspace]
```
Returns JSON containing exact file path, start line, end line, AST node kind, and full definition snippet.

### 3. Symbol Caller Lineage (`references`)
```bash
./tools/omni-graph/scripts/omni.sh references "init_pool" [workspace]
```
Finds all functions and tests in the graph with directional `CALLS` or `IMPORTS` edges pointing to the target symbol.

### 4. Agent Relationship Augmentation (`relate`)
```bash
./tools/omni-graph/scripts/omni.sh relate <source_sym> <target_sym> [relation_type] [workspace]
```
Tree-Sitter parsers only extract static in-file AST edges (`category: "EXTRACTED"`). When you discover dynamic cross-process or runtime relationships (e.g. React UI connecting via SSE to FastAPI, or WebSocket event dispatchers), use `relate` to augment SurrealDB with inferred edges (`category: "INFERRED"`). If either node is external or virtual, Omni-Graph synthesizes auxiliary virtual components automatically.

### 5. Condensed Multi-Hop Subgraph (`condense`)
```bash
./tools/omni-graph/scripts/omni.sh condense "init_pool" [workspace] 2
```
Outputs a dense, beautifully formatted Markdown slice with definitions, signatures, and ASCII call graph traces ready to paste into your reasoning context.

### 6. Semantic Vector Search (`search`)
```bash
./tools/omni-graph/scripts/omni.sh search "websocket message dispatcher" [workspace] 5
```
Performs 384-dimensional cosine ANN vector search across SurrealDB HNSW index.

### 7. Hybrid Graph-RAG Retrieval (`query`)
```bash
./tools/omni-graph/scripts/omni.sh query "How does authentication flow work?" [workspace] 5
```
Combines microscopic vector seeds with macroscopic Louvain community cluster summaries and expanded AST subgraphs.

## 📋 Recommended Agent Workflow Recipes

### Recipe A: Investigating a Bug in an Unfamiliar Module
1. Run `make workspaces` to confirm the workspace name (e.g. `session-explorer`).
2. Run `make graph-galaxies PROJECT=session-explorer` to find which subsystem owns the feature.
3. Run `make search-graph Q="<error term or function>" PROJECT=session-explorer` to get the entrypoint symbol.
4. Run `make graph-condense SYM=<entrypoint> PROJECT=session-explorer HOPS=2` to understand the full call trace.
5. Only now open the specific target file via `view_file` at the exact line range to write your fix.

### Recipe B: Refactoring or Renaming a Function
1. Run `make graph-symbol SYM=<target>` to inspect its current implementation and line range.
2. Run `make graph-references SYM=<target>` to get a complete, guaranteed list of all caller locations and test files that depend on it.
3. Edit the definition and all callers with targeted changes, ensuring zero broken dependencies.

### Recipe C: Augmenting Dynamic Cross-Service Dependencies
1. When inspecting system configuration, Dockerfiles, or client-server communications (e.g. frontend fetching from backend endpoint), identify runtime connections that static AST parsers cannot detect.
2. Run `make relate-graph SRC="ChatUI" TGT="FastAPI" TYPE="ROUTES_TO" PROJECT="QuarkDock"` (or call `POST /api/relationships`).
3. Future agent sessions and blast-radius queries (`make graph-references SYM=FastAPI`) will immediately reveal these callers across system boundaries.

## 🌿 Git Worktree & Ephemeral Branch Fabric (EBF)

When coding agents operate in Git worktrees located outside the main repository directory:

1. **Auto-Detection**: Omni-Graph automatically inspects `.git` gitdir pointers in $O(1)$, resolving the worktree name, current branch, and parent repository workspace.
2. **Cluster Continuity**: During worktree ingestion, Omni-Graph inherits community seeds from the parent workspace, preventing cluster ID shifts across branches.
3. **Auto-Watch Live Sync**: Ingestion automatically enrolls the live filesystem watcher (`watch: true`), ensuring code edits by agents are immediately re-indexed into SurrealDB within 500ms.
4. **Parent-Child Hierarchy**:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/workspaces
   ```
   Returns parent repositories with their active child worktrees nested in `worktrees: [...]`, including branch names and AST node counts.
5. **Inspecting Active Worktrees**:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/worktrees
   ```
   Lists all registered worktrees, root paths, branch names, node counts, and live watcher status (`"is_watching": true`).
6. **Automatic Worktree Sync (`/api/worktrees/sync`)**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/worktrees/sync -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
   ```
   Scans `.git/worktrees`, detects any newly added worktrees (`git worktree add`), and kicks off background ingestion + live watchers automatically.
7. **Scoped vs. Unscoped Multi-Worktree Queries**:
   - **Scoped Query (Targeted)**: Always specify `workspace=<worktree_id>` when exploring code in a specific worktree:
     ```bash
     curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/symbol?name=process_order&workspace=wt-stripe-v3"
     curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/references?symbol=process_order&workspace=wt-stripe-v3"
     curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/condense?symbol=process_order&workspace=wt-stripe-v3&hops=2"
     ```
     SurrealDB strictly partitions AST nodes and call graph edges (`linked_to`). Callers and dependencies from other branches will never bleed into your result.
   - **Unscoped Query (Divergence Check)**: Omit `workspace` to inspect all diverged implementations across active worktrees:
     ```bash
     curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/symbol?name=process_order"
     ```
     Returns an array of all distinct matches, each labeled with its respective `workspace`, `file_path`, and line bounds.
8. **Automatic & Manual Purging**:
   - Dead worktrees whose directories have been removed are automatically swept upon `/api/workspaces` queries.
   - To manually decommission a worktree and stop its watcher:
     ```bash
     curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/worktree/<worktree_name>
     ```

### Recipe D: Working Across Parallel Git Worktrees
1. Run `curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/worktrees` to see all active branches and their workspace IDs.
2. Determine which branch you are editing. If the PreInvocation hook injected `[Omni-Graph Active | Workspace: <worktree_id>]`, use that `<worktree_id>`.
3. Query symbol definitions and blast radiuses using the scoped parameter: `?symbol=<name>&workspace=<worktree_id>`.
4. If checking for divergence across branches, omit `workspace` to view the cross-worktree array side-by-side.
5. To extract call lineages without cross-branch contamination, run `make graph-condense SYM=<target> PROJECT=<worktree_id> HOPS=2`.
