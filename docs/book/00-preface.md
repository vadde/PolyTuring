## Welcome

Welcome to the **PolyTuring Book** — the definitive guide to building,
managing, and evolving engineering tools in the `vadde/PolyTuring` repository.

This book is designed for:

- **Engineers** who want to build and contribute tools
- **AI Agents** that autonomously develop, test, and maintain tools
- **Technical Leaders** who want to understand the architecture and governance

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Modern engineering demands an ever-growing arsenal of tools: scripts that
validate data, plugins that extend workflows, utilities that automate tedium,
and applications that push the boundaries of what's computationally possible.

Without structure, these tools become a graveyard of abandoned scripts. With
the right architecture, they become a **living ecosystem** — discoverable,
testable, maintainable, and composable.

This repository provides that architecture.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Every Tool Is a First-Class Citizen

No matter how simple — a 10-line bash script or a multi-file GenAI pipeline —
every tool gets the same treatment:
- A specification
- A test suite
- Documentation
- A lifecycle status

### 2. Spec-Driven Development

We don't write code first. We write specs first. The spec is the contract
between what we want and what we build. Code is merely the implementation
of that contract.

### 3. Polyglot by Design

Python for data science. Go for performance. Rust for safety. Shell for
automation. TypeScript for web. Each tool chooses the language that fits.
The repository structure is language-agnostic.

### 4. Agent-Native

This repository is built for AI agents as much as for humans. Every rule,
convention, and structure is designed to be discoverable and parseable by
autonomous coding agents.

### 5. Quality Is Non-Negotiable

Every tool has tests. Every tool has documentation. Every tool has a spec.
No exceptions.
