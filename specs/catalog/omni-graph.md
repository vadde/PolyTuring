## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

AI coding agents — from Cursor to Claude Code to Antigravity — navigate codebases using primitive, token-wasteful operations: recursive `cat`, `grep`, and linear file-walking. These approaches:

- **Burn context windows**: A single "understand the codebase" cycle can consume 50K+ tokens of raw file content, leaving little room for reasoning.
- **Lack structural awareness**: Text search cannot distinguish a function _definition_ from a function _call_, or trace a 3-hop dependency chain from `handler → service → repository`.
- **Produce stale context**: Every time an agent restarts, it re-reads the same files from scratch with no persistent memory.
- **Cannot cluster semantics**: Agents cannot answer "which files are functionally related?" without exhaustively reading all of them.

The state-of-the-art (Graphify, CodeGraph, Serena) proves that deterministic AST parsing + vector embedding + graph storage eliminates these inefficiencies. But no existing tool delivers the full pipeline as a single, containerized, local-first system optimized for Apple Silicon.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

**Omni-Graph** is a 100% local, multi-container semantic knowledge hub that models codebases as rich **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) graphs** augmented with **384-dimensional vector embeddings**. It provides:

1. **Rust Orchestrator (Axum)**: High-performance ingestion engine using tree-sitter for deterministic, multi-language AST parsing. Pipes semantic blocks to a local embedding inference engine, stores structured nodes/edges in a multi-model database, and serves a graph analytics REST API.
2. **SurrealDB v2**: Multi-model database serving as both relational graph store (first-class `RELATE` edges) and vector similarity engine (HNSW index, 384-dim, cosine distance).
3. **HuggingFace TEI**: Runs `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` locally for zero-cost, zero-latency embedding vectorization. ARM64-native with SIMD acceleration.
4. **React + TypeScript + Cosmograph UI**: Premium WebGL force-directed graph visualization. GPU-accelerated layout for 100K+ nodes. Semantic galaxies via community detection coloring.

All four services are orchestrated via Docker Compose on a dedicated network (`omni-net`), purpose-built for Apple Silicon ARM64 unified memory.

### 1.3 Target Audience

| Persona | Needs |
|---------|-------|
| **AI Coding Agent** | Query `/api/graph` for structural context instead of `cat`/`grep` — traces call chains, finds dependencies, discovers related code semantically |
| **Senior Engineer** | Visualize codebase topology, identify god-objects, trace cross-file dependency chains |
| **Tech Lead / Architect** | Understand system decomposition, community clustering, coupling metrics |
| **DevOps / Platform Engineer** | Monitor service health, manage the local container stack |

### 1.4 Success Criteria

- A single `docker compose up` launches the full stack on ARM64 macOS
- Tree-sitter parses a 1000-file polyglot codebase in < 60 seconds
- `/api/graph` returns a complete node/link JSON payload in < 500ms
- Cosmograph UI renders 10K+ nodes at 60fps+ with smooth force-directed animation
- Vector similarity search (`/api/search?q=...`) returns top-10 results in < 200ms
- Zero external network dependencies — fully air-gapped operation

| `IMPLEMENTS` | Implements trait/interface | AST: `impl_item` with trait path |
| `DEPENDS_ON` | File-level dependency | Inferred from imports |
| `TYPE_REF` | Type reference/annotation | AST: type annotations, generics |

Categorization follows Graphify's `[EXTRACTED]` vs `[INFERRED]` taxonomy:
- **EXTRACTED**: Directly observed in AST (CALLS, IMPORTS, CONTAINS, IMPLEMENTS)
- **INFERRED**: Resolved by cross-file analysis (DEPENDS_ON, TYPE_REF)

### 7.4 SurrealQL Schema

```sql
-- Schema-full node table
DEFINE TABLE node SCHEMAFULL;
DEFINE FIELD text       ON TABLE node TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD label      ON TABLE node TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD kind       ON TABLE node TYPE string;  -- function, struct, class, import, module
DEFINE FIELD file_path  ON TABLE node TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD language   ON TABLE node TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD line_start ON TABLE node TYPE int;
DEFINE FIELD line_end   ON TABLE node TYPE int;
DEFINE FIELD embedding  ON TABLE node TYPE array<float> ASSERT array::len($value) = 384;
DEFINE FIELD community  ON TABLE node TYPE option<int>;
DEFINE FIELD file_hash  ON TABLE node TYPE option<string>;
DEFINE FIELD created_at ON TABLE node TYPE datetime DEFAULT time::now();
DEFINE FIELD updated_at ON TABLE node TYPE datetime DEFAULT time::now();

-- HNSW vector similarity index
DEFINE INDEX idx_node_embedding ON TABLE node FIELDS embedding
  HNSW DIMENSION 384 DIST COSINE TYPE F32;

-- Auxiliary indexes
DEFINE INDEX idx_node_file     ON TABLE node FIELDS file_path;
DEFINE INDEX idx_node_language ON TABLE node FIELDS language;
DEFINE INDEX idx_node_kind     ON TABLE node FIELDS kind;

-- Relation table
DEFINE TABLE linked_to TYPE RELATION;
DEFINE FIELD type       ON TABLE linked_to TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD category   ON TABLE linked_to TYPE string;  -- EXTRACTED or INFERRED
DEFINE FIELD created_at ON TABLE linked_to TYPE datetime DEFAULT time::now();
```

### 7.5 UI Design Philosophy

- **Dark theme default**: Deep slate/navy backgrounds (#0a0e17, #111827)
- **WebGL canvas**: Cosmograph GPU-accelerated force-directed layout
- **Community galaxies**: Distinct color clusters using a 12-color curated palette
- **Glassmorphic panels**: Semi-transparent metadata sidebar with `backdrop-filter: blur()`
- **Typography**: Inter or JetBrains Mono (code blocks)
- **Micro-animations**: Node hover glow, edge path highlights, zoom transitions
- **Responsive**: Works on large monitors (2560px+) and standard displays (1440px)

### 7.6 Inspirations & Prior Art

| Project | Key Technique Borrowed |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Graphify** | `[EXTRACTED]` vs `[INFERRED]` edge categorization; Leiden community detection; zero-LLM AST parsing |
| **CodeGraph** | File watcher daemon with FSEvents + debounce; content-hash staleness detection |
| **Serena** | Agent-first tool design; symbolic query interface over raw text; LSP semantic operations |
| **ECC Agent Harness** | Content-hash caching; PreToolUse guardrails for token throughput optimization |
| **Microsoft GraphRAG** | Hierarchical community detection & macroscopic summary aggregation |
| **RAGFlow** | Deep document parsing & structural chunking over raw lexical chunking |

### 7.7 Multi-Layered Agent Enforcement Architecture

The central flaw of standard agent architectures is the **Cognitive Drift Gap**: even when instructed in `AGENTS.md` to avoid recursive `grep`/`cat`, an LLM agent under complex task load defaults to primitive text searching because `run_command("grep ...")` is deeply embedded in foundational pre-training.

To ensure deterministic compliance, Omni-Graph implements a **4-tier enforcement shield**:

### 7.8 Antigravity Hooks, Skills & Rules Specification

#### 1. Lifecycle Hooks (`hooks.json`)

Located in `.agents/hooks.json` (workspace) or configured globally:

```json
{
  "omni-graph-guardrail": {
    "enabled": true,
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "run_command|grep_search",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "./tools/omni-graph/scripts/hook_pre_tool.sh",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreInvocation": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "./tools/omni-graph/scripts/hook_pre_invocation.sh",
        "timeout": 5
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "./tools/omni-graph/scripts/hook_stop.sh",
        "timeout": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **`hook_pre_tool.sh`**: Inspects tool args. If `grep -rn` or recursive `find`/`cat` is detected across >10 files, outputs `{"decision": "deny", "reason": "Blind whole-repo grep blocked. Use Omni-Graph semantic search (/api/search) or symbol lookup (/api/graph) instead."}` or rewrites command with `overwrite`.
- **`hook_pre_invocation.sh`**: Injects `{"injectSteps": [{"ephemeralMessage": "Omni-Graph is ACTIVE. Query http://localhost:8080/api/graph or run `omni search <q>` for codebase structure."}]}`.
- **`hook_stop.sh`**: Verifies that any reported structural architecture matches indexed nodes.

#### 2. Antigravity Skill (`skills/omni-graph/SKILL.md`)

Provides concise step-by-step workflows and scripts for:
- Querying symbol definitions, callers, and callees without token waste.
- Fetching condensed AST subgraphs (<1500 tokens).
- Checking Docker cluster health (`omni status`).

#### 3. Automated Setup Command (`make setup-agent`)

Provides an automated setup utility:
```bash
make setup-agent TARGET=workspace   # Installs to .agents/ (repo-level)
make setup-agent TARGET=global      # Installs to ~/.gemini/config (machine-wide)
```
- Validates Docker daemon and Omni-Graph container health.
- Configures `rules/`, `skills/omni-graph/`, and `hooks.json`.
- Tests roundtrip connectivity from agent tool calling to SurrealDB and TEI.

## 8. Open Questions

- [ ] Should community detection (Leiden) run in Rust or as a SurrealQL function?
- [ ] Should the file watcher (R-021) be a separate sidecar container or embedded in the Rust app?
- [ ] Should we support incremental graph updates (patch) or full re-ingestion only?
- [ ] What is the maximum supported codebase size (files/LOC) before memory pressure?
- [ ] Should the UI support 3D mode (`spaceDimensions: 3`) via Cosmograph?
