### Key Technical Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-10-07 | Unified Record ID Normalization (R-050) | Centralized `clean_record_id` stripping `node:`, `⟨...⟩`, and backticks across all storage/edge queries; standardizes fallback/config parser node IDs to `{}:{}:{}` format, eliminating all 114 orphaned edges in SurrealDB |
| 2026-10-07 | Scoped Cross-File Receiver & Impl Target Scoping (R-045) | 3-part source IDs (`ws:file:Struct`) resolve locally in file, then workspace scope; falls back to empty relation array `[]` instead of creating phantom node IDs |
| 2026-10-07 | Cascading Edge Pruning on Node Pruning (R-046) | In `delete_file`, cascade delete both outbound (`in IN $nodes`) and inbound (`out IN $nodes`) edges, eliminating dangling pointers and WebGL UI crashes |
| 2026-10-07 | Stale File Pruning in Batch Ingestion (R-047) | Call `delete_file` prior to re-indexing stale files in `ingest_directory` to prevent duplicate symbol nodes and shifted line numbers |
| 2026-10-07 | Trait & Class Inheritance Graph Extraction (R-048) | Rust `impl Trait for Struct` emits `IMPLEMENTS`; Python `class A(B)` emits `EXTENDS`; TS/JS `extends` and `implements` emit `EXTENDS` and `IMPLEMENTS` |
| 2026-10-07 | Rust Macro Definition & Invocation (R-049) | Tree-sitter `macro_definition` emits `kind: "macro"`; `macro_invocation` emits `CALLS` edge |
| 2026-10-07 | Polyglot Tree-sitter AST Hardening (R-031) | Added Go struct methods, structs, interfaces, consts, TS arrow functions, type aliases, interfaces, Rust `impl_item` (`DECLARES` edge), `enum_item`, `trait_item`, and Python async coroutines |
| 2026-10-07 | Relational Delta Sync Outbound Only (R-032) | Reindexing a single file prunes only `in IN $nodes` (outbound edges), preserving inbound caller edges to prevent graph fragmentation |
| 2026-10-07 | SurrealQL Pre-Limit Exact Ordering (R-033) | Injected `(label = $name) AS is_exact` with `ORDER BY is_exact DESC, label ASC LIMIT 20` directly in query to ensure exact matches are never masked by substring hits |
| 2026-10-07 | Scoped Call-Edge Resolution (R-035) | Resolved AST call links locally within the source file first, preventing common function names from cross-linking into foreign packages |
| 2026-10-07 | Pre-Computed Galaxy Graph-RAG Retrieval (R-036) | Switched `GraphRagEngine::query` to read pre-computed `galaxy` table records instead of pulling the entire workspace graph over HTTP |
| 2026-10-07 | Context-Enriched Vector Embeddings (R-037) | Prepended structured header `[{language}] {kind} {label} in {file_path}\n{text}` before passing to TEI, boosting semantic relevance |
| 2026-10-02 | Nginx 600s Proxy Timeout & 300s SurrealDB Client | Configured 600s proxy timeouts in `nginx.conf` and 300s in `DbClient` with indexed `linked_to` deletion, resolving the "Unknown error" 504 drops on large repos (DSA) |
| 2026-10-02 | Atomic Workspace Purge & Non-Blocking Ingest UX | Implemented 4-step atomic purge in SurrealDB (`DELETE linked_to -> DELETE node -> DELETE galaxy`), cleared in-memory staleness hashes, replaced blocking modal with instant dismiss into non-blocking progress toast with 5-minute timeout window |
| 2026-09-30 | Node Inspector Breadcrumbs & Caller Stack | Added `nodeHistory` stack, interactive breadcrumbs, `Back to [prev]` button, and `Return to caller` action in BoundaryContractCard for one-click return from foreign callers |
| 2026-09-30 | Progressive Windowing & Flexbox Isolation | SubsystemTopologyHub uses `visibleCount` progressive slicing and `flexShrink: 0` to prevent flex collapse on 250+ cluster workspaces (QuarkDock) |
| 2026-09-30 | Live Watch HUD Consolidation | Unified live file watching and background modularity under single `LIVE WATCH` HUD; removed redundant top-bar chip |
| 2026-09-30 | Dynamic Live Galaxy Clustering (Dual-Phase) | Instant single-file community inheritance in reindex_file + quiescent (3.5s) background re-clustering using seed-preserving weighted LPA |
| 2026-09-30 | Agent Boundary Contracts (/api/galaxy/boundary) | Exposes macro subsystem containment, cross-galaxy callers, Robert C. Martin coupling metrics (Ca, Ce, Instability I), and actionable risk advice |
| 2026-09-26 | Dual-Source Telemetry (SurrealDB + Transcripts) | Blends real-time SurrealDB `agent_api_call` events with IDE session logs using `max(t, db)` per capability/workspace |
| 2026-09-24 | HNSW index (not MTREE) for vector similarity | SurrealDB v2 production-ready ANN index; MTREE deprecated/experimental |
| 2026-09-24 | TEI CPU-only in Docker (not Metal) | macOS Docker doesn't support GPU passthrough; Metal only via native Homebrew |
| 2026-09-24 | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-dim) | Lightweight, high-quality BERT-based embeddings, ARM64 SIMD optimized |
| 2026-09-24 | Cosmograph for WebGL graph viz | GPU-accelerated force-directed layout; handles 100K+ nodes at 60fps |
| 2026-09-24 | Edge taxonomy: EXTRACTED vs INFERRED | Following Graphify's proven categorization pattern |

## Next Steps

> _What to do when you pick this tool up. Updated at the end of every session._

1. Multi-container stack (SurrealDB, TEI, Rust API, React UI) fully operational, zero orphaned edges verified across all workspaces.
2. 64/64 unit tests passing, strict Clippy clean (`-D warnings`), UI typecheck clean (`tsc --noEmit`).
3. Requirements R-001 through R-050 100% complete with full traceability.
4. Ready for human review and validation on feature branch `feat/dynamic-galaxy-clustering-agent-primitives`.
